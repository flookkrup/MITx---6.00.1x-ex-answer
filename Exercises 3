Exercises 3

True or False? A stored-program computer is designed to compute precisely one computation, such as a square root, or the trajectory of a missile.
 Answer: False 
True or False? A fixed program computer is designed to run any computation, by interpreting a sequence of program instructions that are read into it.
Answer: False 
A program counters
points the computer to the next instruction to execute the program.

What does it mean when we say that "the computer walks through the sequence executing some computation"?
The computer executes the instructions mostly in a linear sequence, except sometimes it jumps to a different place in the sequence.
True or False? To compute everything that is computable, every computer must be able to handle the sixteen most primitive operations.
